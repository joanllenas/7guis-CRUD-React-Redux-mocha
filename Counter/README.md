# 7guis - Counter (ReactJS + Mocha)

### Counter exercise
_from the [7guis wiki](https://github.com/eugenkiss/7guis/wiki#counter)_

> **Challenges**: understanding the basic ideas of a language/toolkit and the essential scaffolding

> 
> The task is to build a frame containing a label or read-only textfield *T* and a button *B*. Initially, the value in *T* is “0” and each click of *B* increases the value in *T* by one.

> Counter serves as a gentle introduction to the basics of the language, paradigm and toolkit for one of the simplest GUI applications. Thus, by comparing Counter implementations one can clearly see what basic scaffolding is needed and how the very basic features work together to build a GUI application. A good solution will have very minimal scaffolding.


### Install

```bash
npm install
```

to install all dependencies.

### Run
You can build the project:

```bash
